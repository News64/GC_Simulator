GC Battle Simulator

To use a card that is not yet included:
1. Set up the colosseum attribute buffs, red EX and the card's attribute
2. Enter the 6 stats manually into the boxes
3. Click 'Re-apply Boosts', and the stats in the boxes will update
(Don't change the dropboxes mentioned in the first step after this, because that would refresh the boxes!)
Choosing skills and blue EX will not affect the stats, so feel free to do so.
